# Weather Application

## Overview

This application determines the weather, using the openWeatherAPI.


### What I learend

What I learend from the application is how to handle external API inside node.js applciaton using the express library. Also on the browswer side, I leared how to use fetch, async, and await.

#### TODO

Still need to get a pretty UI going, may need to do some research on how to make a pretty website. I am using grid and flexbox and still have not used any 3rd party libraries.

##### UI Changes

1. Add a decent looking header
2. Make the form look better
3. Add and header to the weather card section
4. Fix Footer section
5. Desing the Website for a wider witdth.
6. Set up media queries to reflect the changes.



##### Javascript Changes

1. Make it so the app adds all of the weather cards not just the latest one.
