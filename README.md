# Weather Application

## Overview

This application determines the weather, using the openWeatherAPI.


### What I learend

What I learend from the application is how to handle external API inside node.js applciaton using the express library. Also on the browswer side, I leared how to use fetch, async, and await.

### What could be better

Still need to get a pretty UI going, may need to do some research on how to make a pretty website. I am using grid and flexbox and still have not used any 3rd.
